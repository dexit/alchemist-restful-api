# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the Alchemist Restful API repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **master** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-12 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md).

## Dependencies

The Alchemist Restful API tries to keep dependencies to zero. If you feel that a dependency is necessary, please discuss it with me before adding it to the project.

## Framework-agnostic

The Alchemist Restful API is a framework-agnostic project. Please do not add any framework specific code to the project.

## Testing

All pull requests must be accompanied by passing feature tests and complete code coverage. The Alchemist Restful API uses phpunit for testing.
